<p>
<b>SQL The Structured Query Language,</b> serves as the go-to programming language for handling and controlling data within relational database management systems (RDBMS).<br>

It operates as a standard across various relational database systems like <b>Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others</b>.<br>

With SQL, you wield the power to  <b>create, modify, and remove database tables,</b> alongside the ability to <b>insert, update, and remove</b> data contained within these tables.<br>

Moreover, SQL enables the <b>retrieval of data through queries</b> that can filter, sort, and aggregate information, allowing for precise manipulation based on specific criteria.</p>
